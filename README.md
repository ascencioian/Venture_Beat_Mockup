# Venture Beat Website Mockup
This project is a wireframe developed as a mockup to the popular newspaper website Venture Beat. Images were sourced to have content similar to what Venture Beat had for its headlines in 2020. The content, color scheme, logos, and top navigation links were marked up to be as close as possible to the original.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

To make this wireframe we are going to be using HTML for the content and CSS to markup. We are sourcing images that are publicly available. We are using floats to move around our content.  There is a banner to represent the most important headline of the day. There are additional sections which represent less important news of the day. 

## Optimizations


## Lessons Learned:

A great lesson learned from this website is the importance of displaying the most important information first. Since this is a newspaper site the biggest image should always be the most important headline of the day. Image sizing and header sizing are very important to show the user what is the most important content and what is the least important.
